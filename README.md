## Introductions 👋

This exercise should serve the purpose of getting you to have _some_ experience with git especially in teams. 

### TODOS:
1. Clone this repo (and checkout to correct branch).
2. Create a new branch titled introductions-[firstName] (e.g. introductions-mert).
3. Modify **this** file and add your name to the table below 👇.
4. Add and commit this file (with a helpful commit message see: [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0).
5. Push onto github and submit a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
6. Find someone on the Discord to approve your PR (Pull Request). If you are the approver feel free to nitpick on styling!
7. After your PR has been approved, merge your changes and you're done! 

> ***Warning***: step 7 likely not going to be as smooth as you expect, and you will likely get a merge conflict. A part of this challenge is to resolve those merge conflicts and you may need to repeat steps 4-7 multiple times to get everything to work. Remember if frustration seeps in don't take it out on the commit message, still make them useful. (I better not see something like fix: resolved merge conflict)
